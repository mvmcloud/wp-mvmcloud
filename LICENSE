(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MVMCloud grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software only on hardware systems owned, leased or controlled by you, during the applicable License Term. The term of each Software license ("License Term") will be specified in your Order. Your License Term will end upon any breach of this Agreement.

(iii) Unless otherwise specified in your Order, for each Software license that you purchase, you may use one production instance of the Software in a MVMCloud Analytics instance subscribed by you, and accessible via one URL ("MVMCloud Analytics instance").

(iv) Licenses granted by MVMCloud are granted subject to the condition that you must ensure the maximum number of Authorized Users and Authorized Sites that are able to access and use the Software is equal to the number of User and Site Licenses for which the necessary fees have been paid to MVMCloud for the Subscription period. You may upgrade your license at any time on payment of the appropriate fees to MVMCloud in order to increase the maximum number of authorized users or sites. The number of User and Site Licenses granted to you is dependent on the fees paid by you. “User License” means a license granted under this EULA to you to permit an Authorized User to use the Software. “Authorized User” means a person who has an account in the MVMCloud Analytics instance and for which the necessary fees (“Subscription fees”) have been paid to MVMCloud for the current license term. "Site License" means a license granted under this EULA to you to permit an Authorized Site to use the MVMCloud Analytics Plugin. “Authorized Sites” means a website or a measurable within MVMCloud Analytics instance and for which the necessary fees (“Subscription fees”) have been paid to MVMCloud for the current license term.

(v) Any information that MVMCloud may collect from you or your device will be subject to MVMCloud Privacy Policy (https://www.mvmcloud.net/en/privacy-statement).

(vi) You are bound by the MVMCloud Terms of Use (https://www.mvmcloud.net/en/terms-use).

(vii) You may not reverse engineer or disassemble or re-distribute the Software in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the Software, unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by MVMCloud.

(viii) The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. MVMCloud owns all title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software, and the Software is licensed to you directly by MVMCloud, not sold.

(ix) The Software is provided under an "as is" basis and without any support or maintenance. Nothing in this Agreement shall require MVMCloud to provide you with support or fixes to any bug, failure, mis-performance or other defect in The Software. MVMCloud may provide you, from time to time, according to his sole discretion, with updates of the Software. You hereby warrant to keep the Software up-to-date and install all relevant updates.

MVMCloud shall not be liable or responsible in any way for any losses or damage of any kind, including lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages, relating to your use of or reliance upon the Software.

(xi) MVMCloud may update or modify this Agreement from time to time, including the referenced Privacy Policy and the Terms of Usee. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical contact you designate in the applicable Order).
